# Pet_2_Vet
Pet care helper - server

We want to help pet owners take better care of  their friends. App can store medical records, diet data and much more!

How it works?
  Register your account, 
  add pets and create its profile, 
  add appointments with veterinarians, vaccination dates and reminders about them, notes and have them and manage with you whenever you need to.
 
It's a backend part of the application that provides the API that enables the above.
